# Lazy Gold Maker Web App
Collaboration with the Lazy Gold Maker to create his wonderful spreadsheet into a web application.

For now, I will adding in the new recipes just about one page a day. It's going to be quite the journey...

## TODO
- Will need to complete, the recipes list in recipes.js.
- Will need to refactor the Rank Selector widget from the static 1-3 rankings and replace them with a dynamic one that will update, well, dynamically, depending on how many ranks there are.. That sounds redundant.
- Hook up the API (it's not being used now in order to save bandwith / cost of calls from AWS while in development.)
